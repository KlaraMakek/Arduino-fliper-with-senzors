# Arduino-fliper-with-senzors
The digital game Arduino Pinball is conceived as an arcade game in which players win points controlling the ball on the game board. The primary goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned by shooting various objects on the game board. At the bottom of the board are the pinball machines he controls player.

You will need 4 Gravity: Digital Vibration Sensor, 2 Arduino microcontrollers, Two Servo Motor MG996 180 Degree Rotation, one LCD 2x16 screen, wires, Gravity: Digital Push Button, and a speaker.

There are two documents because the Arduino MRK1000 cannot withstand sensors, servo motors and the screen without the help of additional parts aka coolers. If you can connect everything to one, watch out for overheating.
